# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 6, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Well, I tweeted my public commitment on twitter

**Thoughts:** I've planned and prepared for this for the past 3 days now so I'm feeling a little bit confident about the challange... maybe be a little too confident, lol. I also told some developer guys in my network that I barely know.. now I reallyyy gotta go through with this! lol. But as you can tell I am full postive vibes only! and hopefully I maintain this till the end.. xiao

### Day 1: September 7, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
