# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 6, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Well, I tweeted my public commitment on twitter

**Thoughts:** I've planned and prepared for this for the past 3 days now so I'm feeling a little bit confident about the challange... maybe be a little too confident, lol. I also told some developer guys in my network that I barely know.. now I reallyyy gotta go through with this! lol. But as you can tell I am full postive vibes only! and hopefully I maintain this till the end.. xiao

### Day 1: September 7, Monday

**Today's Progress**: So I wrote the html for my freecodecamp tribute page project. Yen yen yen yen "html is not a programming language" whatever! What's important is that I did it!

**Thoughts** Aaaaaaaaargh!!! Had a meeting that ran for 4 hours and well past midnight leaving me with very little time to do all I intented to do. Well, I guess little progress is better than no progress.
