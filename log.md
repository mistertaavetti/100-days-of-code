# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 6, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Well, I tweeted my public commitment on twitter

**Thoughts:** I've planned and prepared for this for the past 3 days now so I'm feeling a little bit confident about the challange... maybe be a little too confident, lol. I also told some developer guys in my network that I barely know.. now I reallyyy gotta go through with this! lol. But as you can tell I am full postive vibes only! and hopefully I maintain this till the end.. xiao

### Day 1: September 7, Monday

**Today's Progress**: So I wrote the html for my freecodecamp tribute page project. Yen yen yen yen "html is not a programming language" whatever! What's important is that I did it!

**Thoughts** Aaaaaaaaargh!!! Had a meeting that ran for 4 hours and well past midnight leaving me with very little time to do all I intented to do. Well, I guess little progress is better than no progress.

### Day 2: September 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I wrote the css for and completed the tribute page I started yesterday. I published it on codepen and github. 

**Thoughts** Easy peasy.. no stress. It's something I've done over and over again before now. Just thought starting with the FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Projects is a good way to ease into the challenge. My focus at this point (the beginning) is on building the habit and coding consistently. As I progress, I'll begin to focus more on performance.

### Day 3: September 9, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I did the FreCodeCamp Tribute Page Project. 

**Thoughts** So I'm kinda bothered that my current process through this isn't producing err "original" work, right. Like, cos I literally can just copy the code of the existing template and submit that and I'll still get a pass. What I've been doing so far tho, is to copy the code, change all of the content and almost rewrite the entire html while I'm at it, and then customizing the CSS. so for the next project I want to write the entire HTML of the sample provided from scratch. Then I'mma change up the content and customise the CSS as usual. I'll do that for the next 2 projects, and on the final one, I'm going to design a custom website (fulfilling the required user stories ofcourse) and then code that. That one might take a while tho - a few days probably. I am concerned tho, that cos the time I spend designing ain't gonna count for the challenge.. I don't know. these are just my current thoughts. I'll figure it out. it's 2:42Am (next day) I better catch some sleep.

### Day 4: September 10, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I wasn't able to work on any coding projects today. It was a busy day and then I had a power failure at midnight. It was too lte to do anything about it then. So I guess this means I gotta do 101DaysOfCode Now.. oh well #WeMove!

**Thoughts** I really want to code really cool and original concepts/designs for my projects, but I haven't figured how to create the time to design the projects before coding yet.

### Day 5: September 11, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I hand-typed the html and css for the landing page freecodecamp project and fulfilled all of the user stories

**Thoughts** I'm feeling quite proud of myself. I wrote HTML/CSS without copy and pasting! Great accomplishment for me! I think I will keep this up for the rest of the freeodecamp html/css projects

### Day 6: September 12, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I created an HTML/CSS boilerplate template.

**Thoughts** I set out to code a custom design for my landing page but ended up creating a boilerplate that I'd be improving continously for use for my future html/css projects.

### Day 7: September 14, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the header of my landing page and on my boilerplate.. I'm adding a component library to it.

**Thoughts** I missed a day. It was a hectic one and I needed to rest. Don't feel great about missing it tho.
